# odin-recipes

This is a project conducted by the free course The Odin Project. 
This is a task for me to build my first web page using what i learned form the last few lessons.
I will try my best to use the layout of the boilerplate, the title, headers and lists and be as creative as possible in the development of this tiny website.
